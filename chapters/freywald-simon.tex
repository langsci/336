\maketitle

This chapter was supposed to contain the introduction to this volume, which contains the papers of a
workshop held at the Freie Universität Berlin in May 2017. We think that all the papers are great, stand
for themselves and an introduction is not really necessary. Well, to be honest, we would have loved
to have an introduction here, but due to all these terrible events in the past five years, we did
not really manage to put one together.

We hope to be able to add more content to this chapter in the second edition. For now it is more
important to get the book out.
